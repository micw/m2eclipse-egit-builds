m2eclipse-egit-builds
=====================

Builds of tesla/m2eclipse-egit

Here I'm going to put my builds of the m2eclipse-egit plugin for use from eclipse's plugin manager.

I start with https://github.com/stadler/m2eclipse-egit/tree/egit-3.1 which adds support for egit 3.1.x.

Added latest version from https://github.com/tesla/m2eclipse-egit which allows to use all EGit 3.x versions.
